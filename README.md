# Dark Machinations
## A technology mod for 1.11.2

[![Jenkins](https://img.shields.io/jenkins/s/https/ci.elytradev.com/job/elytra/job/DarkMachinations/job/master.svg)](https://ci.elytradev.com/job/elytra/job/DarkMachinations/job/master/)

Dark Machinations aims to be a technology mod that strikes a better balance than more traditional tech mods, while retaining the feel of playing some of these mods, and the unbridled fun of creating sprawling and impressive tech chains.

Goes well with [Correlated](https://github.com/elytra/Correlated), [Teckle](https://github.com/elytra/Teckle), and [Thermionics](https://github.com/elytra/Thermionics)!

# Balancing Against This Mod

DarkMachinations will, upon release, officially follow the [Thermionics](https://github.com/elytra/Thermionics) standard of balancing.

For your convenience, the entire contents of the relevent section of Thermionics' README is reprinted here:

------------------------

Interop can be hard. Follow these simple rules, and you will experience maximum harmony:

* No ore tripling, quadrupling, quintupling, etc. Ever. - the absolute limit on ore multiplication
is 2.6 ingots per ore block, with typical gains being closer to 1.6
* A single block can never store more than 36 items, even when it's part of a multiblock
structure.
* When an item can be used as furnace fuel, it can often be burned to produce energy. It
should produce no more than 30FU per furnace fuel tick. It can produce this as slowly or
as quickly as you want.
* ~Wireless interactions are permitted, and encouraged because they are often good for servers.~
It has been pointed out to me, rightly, that well-designed network-topography-aware
systems often outstrip the performance of wireless transfer systems, and occasionally
even dumb cellular systems do. More importantly, wireless is unsatisfying gameplay.
* Time is not a balancing mechanic. Free energy that takes a long time to generate is still free
energy. (this is why there are no time constraints placed on energy generation)
* Material cost is not a balancing mechanic. An overpowered machine that requires 26 expensive
casing blocks is overpowered, and also not a real multiblock machine.


Vazkii has some really good writing on passive generation and why you want to avoid it
(http://vazkii.us/uncategorized/sins-of-a-solar-empire-or-the-passive-generation-conundrum/ )
and Extra Credits has a whole video on FOO ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EitZRLt2G3w ).
This is really important, and I feel like we aren't getting it as modpack creators. Please think
about these things. They matter.
